    <p>Content has different formats like text, images, audio, and video. e.g. Books, Blogs/Articles, Newsletters, Tweets, GIFs, Memes, Podcasts, Vlogs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overwhelmed by the information and decrease in attention span have led to increase in consumption of bite-sized content in the form of Twitter threads, Instagram posts/stories, TikTok, etc. Everything has become Game of Content.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everyone is now a content creator, whatever you post on the internet is considered as content.  You dislike someone but still, like his/her content and vice versa.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Creating quality content requires effort and a distribution channel.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Seeking attention online is tough. Due to the attention economy, people have a shorter attention span, if you can’t create better content then people will not consume your content. You can keep sharing your views, whoever finds interesting will follow and ignore the rest.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you keep consuming different types of content, you may feel like you have been learning something, but in reality, probably it’s just enlightenment or epiphany for a shorter time. You read a Twitter thread, feel enlightened, don’t know what to do with this feeling of enlightenment, then you start reading some more threads. Following the virtue-signaling and circle-jerking threads, tweets to gain followers are waste of time. And this vicious circle goes on and creates the illusion of learning or spending quality time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Social media companies spend billions of dollars to keep you hooked on consuming content, it also provides a platform to create content and earn. So review your quality of content consumptions to avoid the illusion of learning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To find better content we need a content curator. Again be careful of your content consumption, too much curation lead to curated content fatigue and living in the bubble, ignoring the rest.</p>
