  <li>Anytime youâ€™re practicing renunciation, youâ€™re deluded. How about that! Youâ€™re
deluded. What are you renouncing? Anytime you renounce something, you are tied
forever to the thing you renounce. Thereâ€™s a guru in India who says, â€œEvery time a
prostitute comes to me, sheâ€™s talking about nothing but God. She says Iâ€™m sick of this life
that Iâ€™m living. I want God. But every time a priest comes to me heâ€™s talking about
nothing but sex.â€ Very well, <strong>when you renounce something, youâ€™re stuck to it forever.
When you fight something, youâ€™re tied to it forever. As long as youâ€™re fighting it, you are
giving it power. You give it as much power as you are using to fight it.</strong></li>
