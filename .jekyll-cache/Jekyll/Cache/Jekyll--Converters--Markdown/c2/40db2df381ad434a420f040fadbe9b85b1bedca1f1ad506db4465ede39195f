  <li>There were things wrong with this story (the biggest hole was probably Rogerâ€™s failure simply to start over with a different glue), but it was cute, it was fairly original, and I knew I had done some pretty good writing. After a long time spent studying the markets in my beat-up Writerâ€™s Digest, I sent â€œHappy Stampsâ€ off to Alfred Hitchcockâ€™s Mystery Magazine. It came back three weeks later with a form rejection slip attached. This slip bore Alfred Hitchcockâ€™s unmistakable profile in red ink and wished me good luck with my story. At the bottom was an unsigned jotted message, the only personal response I got from AHMM over eight years of periodic submissions. â€œDonâ€™t staple manuscripts,â€ the postscript read. â€œLoose pages plus paperclip equal correct way to submit copy.â€ This was pretty cold advice, I thought, but useful in its way. I have never stapled a manuscript since.</li>
