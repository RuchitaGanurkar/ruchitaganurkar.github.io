    <p>There were things wrong with this story (the biggest hole was probably Rogerâ€™s failure simply to start over with a different glue), but it was cute, it was fairly original, and I knew I had done some pretty good writing. After a long time spent studying the markets in my beat-up Writerâ€™s Digest, I sent â€œHappy Stampsâ€ off to Alfred Hitchcockâ€™s Mystery Magazine. It came back three weeks later with a form rejection slip attached. This slip bore Alfred Hitchcockâ€™s unmistakable profile in red ink and wished me good luck with my story. At the bottom was an unsigned jotted message, the only personal response I got from AHMM over eight years of periodic submissions. â€œDonâ€™t staple manuscripts,â€ the postscript read. â€œLoose pages plus paperclip equal correct way to submit copy.â€ This was pretty cold advice, I thought, but useful in its way. I have never stapled a manuscript since.</p>

    <p>When youâ€™re still too young to shave, optimism is a perfectly legitimate response to failure.</p>

    <p>The first of these hopeful notes was from Algis Budrys, then the editor of Fantasy and Science Fiction, who read a story of mine called â€œThe Night of the Tigerâ€ (the inspiration was, I think, an episode of The Fugitive in which Dr. Richard Kimble worked as an attendant cleaning out cages in a zoo or a circus) and wrote: â€œThis is good. Not for us, but good. You have talent. Submit again.â€</p>

    <p>In Brunswick, where he went to high school, Dave found a shop with a small drum printing press for sale. It workedâ€”barely. You typed up your copy on stencils which could be purchased in a local office-supply store for nineteen cents apieceâ€”my brother called this chore â€œcutting stencil,â€ and it was usually my job, as I was less prone to make typing errors. The stencils were attached to the drum of the press, lathered up with the worldâ€™s stinkiest, oogiest ink, and then you were off to the racesâ€”crank â€™til your arm falls off, son. We were able to put together in two nights what had previously taken a week with the hectograph, and while the drum-press was messy, it did not look infected with a potentially fatal disease. Daveâ€™s Rag entered its brief golden age.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After a half-hour or so of pleasant mulling, I typed the words A V.I.B. BOOK in the upper right corner of my title page. V.I.B. stood for Very Important Book.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>â€œWhat I donâ€™t understand, Stevie,â€ she said, â€œis why youâ€™d write junk like this in the first place. Youâ€™re talented. Why do you want to waste your abilities?â€ She had rolled up a copy of V.I.B. #1 and was brandishing it at me the way a person might brandish a rolled-up newspaper at a dog that has piddled on the rug. She waited for me to answerâ€”to her credit, the question was not entirely rhetoricalâ€”but I had no answer to give. I was ashamed. I have spent a good many years sinceâ€”too many, I thinkâ€”being ashamed about what I write. I think I was forty before I realized that almost every writer of fiction and poetry who has ever published a line has been accused by someone of wasting his or her God-given talent. If you write (or paint or dance or sculpt or sing, I suppose), someone will try to make you feel lousy about it, thatâ€™s all. Iâ€™m not editorializing, just trying to give you the facts as I see them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I created a satiric high school newspaper of my own when I should have been captioning photographs for The Drum. What resulted was a four-sheet which I called The Village Vomit. The boxed motto in the upper lefthand corner was not â€œAll the News Thatâ€™s Fit to Printâ€ but â€œAll the Shit That Will Stick.â€ That piece of dimwit humor got me into the only real trouble of my high school career. It also led me to the most useful writing lesson I ever got.</p>

    <p>â€œWhen you write a story, youâ€™re telling yourself the story,â€ he said. â€œWhen you rewrite, your main job is taking out all the things that are not the story.â€</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One day late in my final semester at college, finals over and at loose ends, I recalled the dyehouse guyâ€™s story about the rats under the millâ€”big as cats, goddam, some as big as dogsâ€”and started writing a story called â€œGraveyard Shift.â€ I was only passing the time on a late spring afternoon, but two months later Cavalier magazine bought the story for two hundred dollars. I had sold two other stories previous to this, but they had brought in a total of just sixty-five dollars. This was three times that, and at a single stroke. It took my breath away, it did. I was rich.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the summer of 1969 I got a work-study job in the University of Maine library. That was a season both fair and foul. In Vietnam, Nixon was executing his plan to end the war, which seemed to consist of bombing most of Southeast Asia into Kibbles â€™n Bits. â€œMeet the new boss,â€ The Who sang, â€œsame as the old boss.â€Eugene McCarthy was concentrating on his poetry, and happy hippies wore bell-bottom pants and tee-shirts that said things like KILLING FOR PEACE IS LIKE FUCKING FOR CHASTITY. I had a great set of muttonchop sideburns. Creedence Clearwater Revival was singing â€œGreen Riverâ€â€”barefoot girls, dancing in the moonlightâ€”and Kenny Rogers was still with The First Edition. Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy were dead, but Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, Bob â€œThe Bearâ€ Hite, Jimi Hendrix, Cass Elliot, John Lennon, and Elvis Presley were still alive and making music. I was staying just off campus in Ed Priceâ€™s Rooms (seven bucks a week, one change of sheets included). Men had landed on the moon, and I had landed on the Deanâ€™s List. Miracles and wonders abounded.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One day in late June of that summer, a bunch of us library guys had lunch on the grass behind the university bookstore. Sitting between Paolo Silva and Eddie Marsh was a trim girl with a raucous laugh, red-tinted hair, and the prettiest legs I had ever seen, well-displayed beneath a short yellow skirt. She was carrying a copy of Soul on Ice, by Eldridge Cleaver. I hadnâ€™t run across her in the library, and I didnâ€™t believe a college student could utter such a wonderful, unafraid laugh. Also, heavy reading or no heavy reading, she swore like a mill-worker instead of a coed. (Having been a millworker, I was qualified to judge.) Her name was Tabitha Spruce. We got married a year and a half later. Weâ€™re still married, and she has never let me forget that the first time I met her I thought she was Eddie Marshâ€™s townie girlfriend. Maybe a book-reading waitress from the local pizza joint on her afternoon off.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wasnâ€™t having much success with my own writing, either. Horror, science fiction, and crime stories in the menâ€™s magazines were being replaced by increasingly graphic tales of sex. That was part of the trouble, but not all of it. The bigger deal was that, for the first time in my life, writing was hard. The problem was the teaching. I liked my coworkers and loved the kidsâ€”even the Beavis and Butt-Head types in Living with English could be interestingâ€”but by most Friday afternoons I felt as if Iâ€™d spent the week with jumper cables clamped to my brain. If I ever came close to despairing about my future as a writer, it was then. I could see myself thirty years on, wearing the same shabby tweed coats with patches on the elbows, potbelly rolling over my Gap khakis from too much beer. Iâ€™d have a cigarette cough from too many packs of Pall Malls, thicker glasses, more dandruff, and in my desk drawer, six or seven unfinished manuscripts which I would take out and tinker with from time to time, usually when drunk. If asked what I did in my spare time, Iâ€™d tell people I was writing a bookâ€”what else does any self-respecting creative-writing teacher do with his or her spare time? And of course Iâ€™d lie to myself, telling myself there was still time, it wasnâ€™t too late, there were novelists who didnâ€™t get started until they were fifty, hell, even sixty. Probably plenty of them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And whenever I see a first novel dedicated to a wife (or a husband), I smile and think, Thereâ€™s someone who knows. Writing is a lonely job. Having someone who believes in you makes a lot of difference. They donâ€™t have to make speeches. Just believing is usually enough.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For me writing has always been best when itâ€™s intimate, as sexy as skin on skin.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes you have to go on when you donâ€™t feel like it, and sometimes youâ€™re doing good work when it feels like all youâ€™re managing is to shovel shit from a sitting position.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the morning my stomach has settled a little but my diaphragm is sore from vomiting and my head is throbbing like a mouthful of infected teeth. My eyes have turned into magnifying glasses; the hideously bright morning light coming in through the hotel windows is being concentrated by them and will soon set my brains on fire.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I read where I can, but I have a favorite place and probably you do, tooâ€”a place where the light is good and the vibe is usually strong. For me itâ€™s the blue chair in my study. For you it might be the couch on the sunporch, the rocker in the kitchen, or maybe itâ€™s propped up in your bedâ€”reading in bed can be heaven, assuming you can get just the right amount of light on the page and arenâ€™t prone to spilling your coffee or cognac on the sheets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can approach the act of writing with nervousness, excitement, hopefulness, or even despairâ€”the sense that you can never completely put on the page whatâ€™s in your mind and heart. You can come to the act with your fists clenched and your eyes narrowed, ready to kick ass and take down names. You can come to it because you want a girl to marry you or because you want to change the world. Come to it any way but lightly. Let me say it again: you must not come lightly to the blank page.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Iâ€™m not asking you to come reverently or unquestioningly; Iâ€™m not asking you to be politically correct or cast aside your sense of humor (please God you have one). This isnâ€™t a popularity contest, itâ€™s not the moral Olympics, and itâ€™s not church. But itâ€™s writing, damn it, not washing the car or putting on eyeliner. If you can take it seriously, we can do business. If you canâ€™t or wonâ€™t, itâ€™s time for you to close the book and do something else.
Wash the car, maybe.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Put your vocabulary on the top shelf of your toolbox, and donâ€™t make any conscious effort to improve it. (Youâ€™ll be doing that as you read, of course â€¦ but that comes later.) One of the really bad things you can do to your writing is to dress up the vocabulary, looking for long words because youâ€™re maybe a little bit ashamed of your short ones. This is like dressing up a household pet in evening clothes. The pet is embarrassed and the person who committed this act of premeditated cuteness should be even more embarrassed. Make yourself a solemn promise right now that youâ€™ll never use â€œemolumentâ€ when you mean â€œtipâ€ and youâ€™ll never say John stopped long enough to perform an act of excretion when you mean John stopped long enough to take a shit. If you believe â€œtake a shitâ€ would be considered offensive or inappropriate by your audience, feel free to say John stopped long enough to move his bowels (or perhaps John stopped long enough to â€œpushâ€). Iâ€™m not trying to get you to talk dirty, only plain and direct. Remember that the basic rule of vocabulary is use the first word that comes to your mind, if it is appropriate and colorful. If you hesitate and cogitate, you will come up with another wordâ€”of course you will, thereâ€™s always another wordâ€”but it probably wonâ€™t be as good as your first one, or as close to what you really mean.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The timid fellow writes The meeting will be held at seven oâ€™clock because that somehow says to him, â€œPut it this way and people will believe you really know.â€ Purge this quisling thought! Donâ€™t be a muggle! Throw back your shoulders, stick out your chin, and put that meeting in charge! Write The meetingâ€™s at seven. There, by God! Donâ€™t you feel better?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonâ€™t say thereâ€™s no place for the passive tense. Suppose, for instance, a fellow dies in the kitchen but ends up somewhere else. The body was carried from the kitchen and placed on the parlor sofa is a fair way to put this, although â€œwas carriedâ€ and â€œwas placedâ€ still irk the shit out of me. I accept them but I donâ€™t embrace them. What I would embrace is Freddy and Myra carried the body out of the kitchen and laid it on the parlor sofa. Why does the body have to be the subject of the sentence, anyway? Itâ€™s dead, for Christâ€™s sake! Fuhgeddaboudit!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Two pages of the passive voiceâ€”just about any business document ever written, in other words, not to mention reams of bad fictionâ€”make me want to scream. Itâ€™s weak, itâ€™s circuitous, and itâ€™s frequently tortuous, as well. How about this: My first kiss will always be recalled by me as how my romance with Shayna was begun. Oh, manâ€”who farted, right? A simpler way to express this ideaâ€”sweeter and more forceful, as wellâ€”might be this: My romance with Shayna began with our first kiss. Iâ€™ll never forget it. Iâ€™m not in love with this because it uses with twice in four words, but at least weâ€™re out of that awful passive voice.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other piece of advice I want to give you before moving on to the next level of the toolbox is this: The adverb is not your friend. Adverbs, you will remember from your own version of Business English, are words that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. Theyâ€™re the ones that usually end in -ly. Adverbs, like the passive voice, seem to have been created with the timid writer in mind. With the passive voice, the writer usually expresses fear of not being taken seriously; it is the voice of little boys wearing shoepolish mustaches and little girls clumping around in Mommyâ€™s high heels. With adverbs, the writer usually tells us he or she is afraid he/she isnâ€™t expressing himself/herself clearly, that he or she is not getting the point or the picture across.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Iâ€™m convinced that fear is at the root of most bad writing. If one is writing for oneâ€™s own pleasure, that fear may be mildâ€”timidity is the word Iâ€™ve used here. If, however, one is working under deadlineâ€”a school paper, a newspaper article, the SAT writing sampleâ€”that fear may be intense. Dumbo got airborne with the help of a magic feather; you may feel the urge to grasp a passive verb or one of those nasty adverbs for the same reason. Just remember before you do that Dumbo didnâ€™t need the feather; the magic was in him.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most interesting paragraph is the fifth one: Big Tony sat down, lit a cigarette, ran a hand through his hair. Itâ€™s only a single sentence long, and expository paragraphs almost never consist of a single sentence. Itâ€™s not even a very good sentence, technically speaking; to make it perfect in the Warrinerâ€™s sense, there should be a conjunction (and). Also, what exactly is the purpose of this paragraph?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First, the sentence may be flawed in a technical sense, but itâ€™s a good one in terms of the entire passage. Its brevity and telegraphic style vary the pace and keep the writing fresh. Suspense novelist Jonathan Kellerman uses this technique very successfully. In Survival of the Fittest, he writes: The boat was thirty feet of sleek white fiberglass with gray trim. Tall masts, the sails tied. Satori painted on the hull in black script edged with gold.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The headline is there to get you to view the article, end of story. Whether you get anything out of it after is irrelevantâ€”the click already happened. The Comments section is meant to be used. So are those Share buttons at the bottom of every post. The dirty truth, as Venkatesh Rao, the entrepreneur in residence at Xerox, pointed out, is that</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Social media isnâ€™t a set of tools to allow humans to communicate with humans. It is a set of embedding mechanisms to allow technologies to use humans to communicate with each other, in an orgy of self-organizingâ€¦. The Matrix had it wrong. Youâ€™re not the battery power in a global, human-enslaving AI, you are slightly more valuable. You are part of the switching circuitry.1
As a user, the fact that blogs are not helpful, deliberately misleading, or unnecessarily incendiary might exhaust and tire you, but Orwell reminded us in 1984: â€œThe weariness of the cell is the vigor of the organism.â€</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot. Thereâ€™s no way around these two things that Iâ€™m aware of, no shortcut.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Iâ€™m a slow reader, but I usually get through seventy or eighty books a year, mostly fiction. I donâ€™t read in order to study the craft; I read because I like to read. Itâ€™s what I do at night, kicked back in my blue chair. Similarly, I donâ€™t read fiction to study the art of fiction, but simply because I like stories. Yet there is a learning process going on. Every book you pick up has its own lesson or lessons, and quite often the bad books have more to teach than the good ones.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reading is the creative center of a writerâ€™s life. I take a book with me everywhere I go, and find there are all sorts of opportunities to dip in. The trick is to teach yourself to read in small sips as well as in long swallows. Waiting rooms were made for booksâ€”of course! But so are theater lobbies before the show, long and boring checkout lines, and everyoneâ€™s favorite, the john. You can even read while youâ€™re driving, thanks to the audiobook revolution. Of the books I read each year, anywhere from six to a dozen are on tape. As for all the wonderful radio you will be missing, come onâ€”how many times can you listen to Deep Purple sing â€œHighway Starâ€?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once weaned from the ephemeral craving for TV, most people will find they enjoy the time they spend reading. Iâ€™d like to suggest that turning off that endlessly quacking box is apt to improve the quality of your life as well as the quality of your writing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real importance of reading is that it creates an ease and intimacy with the process of writing; one comes to the country of the writer with oneâ€™s papers and identification pretty much in order. Constant reading will pull you into a place (a mind-set, if you like the phrase) where you can write eagerly and without self-consciousness. It also offers you a constantly growing knowledge of what has been done and what hasnâ€™t, what is trite and what is fresh, what works and what just lies there dying (or dead) on the page. The more you read, the less apt you are to make a fool of yourself with your pen or word processor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the time you step into your new writing space and close the door, you should have settled on a daily writing goal. As with physical exercise, it would be best to set this goal low at first, to avoid discouragement. I suggest a thousand words a day, and because Iâ€™m feeling magnanimous, Iâ€™ll also suggest that you can take one day a week off, at least to begin with. No more; youâ€™ll lose the urgency and immediacy of your story if you do. With that goal set, resolve to yourself that the door stays closed until that goal is met. Get busy putting those thousand words on paper or on a floppy disk. In an early interview (this was to promote Carrie, I think), a radio talk-show host asked me how I wrote. My replyâ€”â€œOne word at a timeâ€â€”seemingly left him without a reply. I think he was trying to decide whether or not I was joking. I wasnâ€™t. In the end, itâ€™s always that simple. Whether itâ€™s a vignette of a single page or an epic trilogy like The Lord of the Rings, the work is always accomplished one word at a time. The door closes the rest of the world out; it also serves to close you in and keep you focused on the job at hand.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If possible, there should be no telephone in your writing room, certainly no TV or videogames for you to fool around with. If thereâ€™s a window, draw the curtains or pull down the shades unless it looks out at a blank wall. For any writer, but for the beginning writer in particular, itâ€™s wise to eliminate every possible distraction. If you continue to write, you will begin to filter out these distractions naturally, but at the start itâ€™s best to try and take care of them before you write. I work to loud musicâ€”hard-rock stuff like AC/DC, Guns â€™n Roses, and Metallica have always been particular favoritesâ€”but for me the music is just another way of shutting the door. It surrounds me, keeps the mundane world out. When you write, you want to get rid of the world, do you not? Of course you do. When youâ€™re writing, youâ€™re creating your own worlds.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And as your mind and body grow accustomed to a certain amount of sleep each nightâ€”six hours, seven, maybe the recommended eightâ€”so can you train your waking mind to sleep creatively and work out the vividly imagined waking dreams which are successful works of fiction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But you need the room, you need the door, and you need the determination to shut the door. You need a concrete goal, as well. The longer you keep to these basics, the easier the act of writing will become. Donâ€™t wait for the muse. As Iâ€™ve said, heâ€™s a hardheaded guy whoâ€™s not susceptible to a lot of creative fluttering. This isnâ€™t the Ouija board or the spirit-world weâ€™re talking about here, but just another job like laying pipe or driving long-haul trucks. Your job is to make sure the muse knows where youâ€™re going to be every day from nine â€™til noon or seven â€™til three. If he does know, I assure you that sooner or later heâ€™ll start showing up, chomping his cigar and making his magic.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think you begin by interpreting â€œwrite what you knowâ€ as broadly and inclusively as possible. If youâ€™re a plumber, you know plumbing, but that is far from the extent of your knowledge; the heart also knows things, and so does the imagination. Thank God. If not for heart and imagination, the world of fiction would be a pretty seedy place. It might not even exist at all.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Book-buyers arenâ€™t attracted, by and large, by the literary merits of a novel; book-buyers want a good story to take with them on the airplane, something that will first fascinate them, then pull them in and keep them turning the pages. This happens, I think, when readers recognize the people in a book, their behaviors, their surroundings, and their talk. When the reader hears strong echoes of his or her own life and beliefs, he or she is apt to become more invested in the story. Iâ€™d argue that itâ€™s impossible to make this sort of connection in a premeditated way, gauging the market like a racetrack tout with a hot tip.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No matter how good you are, no matter how much experience you have, itâ€™s probably impossible to get the entire fossil out of the ground without a few breaks and losses. To get even most of it, the shovel must give way to more delicate tools: airhose, palm-pick, perhaps even a toothbrush. Plot is a far bigger tool, the writerâ€™s jackhammer. You can liberate a fossil from hard ground with a jackhammer, no argument there, but you know as well as I do that the jackhammer is going to break almost as much stuff as it liberates. Itâ€™s clumsy, mechanical, anticreative. Plot is, I think, the good writerâ€™s last resort and the dullardâ€™s first choice. The story which results from it is apt to feel artificial and labored.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation comes first. The charactersâ€”always flat and unfeatured, to begin withâ€”come next. Once these things are fixed in my mind, I begin to narrate. I often have an idea of what the outcome may be, but I have never demanded of a set of characters that they do things my way. On the contrary, I want them to do things their way. In some instances, the outcome is what I visualized. In most, however, itâ€™s something I never expected. For a suspense novelist, this is a great thing. I am, after all, not just the novelâ€™s creator but its first reader. And if Iâ€™m not able to guess with any accuracy how the damned thing is going to turn out, even with my inside knowledge of coming events, I can be pretty sure of keeping the reader in a state of page-turning anxiety. And why worry about the ending anyway? Why be such a control freak? Sooner or later every story comes out somewhere.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the best stories always end up being about the people rather than the event, which is to say character-driven. Once you get beyond the short story, though (two to four thousand words, letâ€™s say), Iâ€™m not much of a believer in the so-called character study; I think that in the end, the story should always be the boss. Hey, if you want a character study, buy a biography or get season tickets to your local collegeâ€™s theater-lab productions. Youâ€™ll get all the character you can stand.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I started taking long walks (a habit which would, two decades later, get me in a lot of trouble). I took a book or magazine on these walks but rarely opened it, no matter how bored I felt looking at the same old trees and the same old chattering, ill-natured jays and squirrels. Boredom can be a very good thing for someone in a creative jam. I spent those walks being bored and thinking about my gigantic boondoggle of a manuscript.</p>
  </li>
  <li>And I repeat: no big deal. These are just interests which have grown out of my life and thought, out of my experiences as a boy and a man, out of my roles as a husband, a father, a writer, and a lover. They are questions that occupy my mind when I turn out the lights for the night and Iâ€™m alone with myself, looking up into the darkness with one hand tucked beneath the pillow.</li>
  <li>
    <p>You undoubtedly have your own thoughts, interests, and concerns, and they have arisen, as mine have, from your experiences and adventures as a human being. Some are likely similar to those Iâ€™ve mentioned above and some are likely very different, but you have them, and you should use them in your work. Thatâ€™s not all those ideas are there for, perhaps, but surely itâ€™s one of the things they are good for.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should close this little sermonette with a word of warningâ€”starting with the questions and thematic concerns is a recipe for bad fiction. Good fiction always begins with story and progresses to theme; it almost never begins with theme and progresses to story. The only possible exceptions to this rule that I can think of are allegories like George Orwellâ€™s Animal Farm (and I have a sneaking suspicion that with Animal Farm the story idea may indeed have come first; if I see Orwell in the afterlife, I mean to ask him).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But once your basic story is on paper, you need to think about what it means and enrich your following drafts with your conclusions. To do less is to rob your work (and eventually your readers) of the vision that makes each tale you write uniquely your own.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now letâ€™s say youâ€™ve finished your first draft. Congratulations! Good job! Have a glass of champagne, send out for pizza, do whatever it is you do when youâ€™ve got something to celebrate. If you have someone who has been impatiently waiting to read your novelâ€”a spouse, letâ€™s say, someone who has perhaps been working nine to five and helping to pay the bills while you chase your dreamâ€”then this is the time to give up the goods â€¦ if, that is, your first reader or readers will promise not to talk to you about the book until you are ready to talk to them about it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With six weeksâ€™ worth of recuperation time, youâ€™ll also be able to see any glaring holes in the plot or character development. Iâ€™m talking about holes big enough to drive a truck through. Itâ€™s amazing how some of these things can elude the writer while he or she is occupied with the daily work of composition. And listenâ€”if you spot a few of these big holes, you are forbidden to feel depressed about them or to beat up on yourself. Screw-ups happen to the best of us. Thereâ€™s a story that the architect of the Flatiron Building committed suicide when he realized, just before the ribbon-cutting ceremony, that he had neglected to put any menâ€™s rooms in his prototypical skyscraper. Probably not true, but remember this: someone really did design the Titanic and then label it unsinkable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I paid attention to my driving and stopped sneaking peeks (well â€¦ almost). About five minutes later, I heard a snort of laughter from my right. Just a little one, but it was enough for me. The truth is that most writers are needy. Especially between the first draft and the second, when the study door swings open and the light of the world shines in.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The scariest moment is always just before you start. After that, things can only get better.</p>

  <li>Writing isnâ€™t about making money, getting famous, getting dates, getting laid, or making friends. In the end, itâ€™s about enriching the lives of those who will read your work, and enriching your own life, as well. Itâ€™s about getting up, getting well, and getting over. Getting happy, okay? Getting happy. Some of this bookâ€”perhaps too muchâ€”has been about how I learned to do it. Much of it has been about how you can do it better. The rest of itâ€”and perhaps the best of itâ€”is a permission slip: you can, you should, and if youâ€™re brave enough to start, you will. Writing is magic, as much the water of life as any other creative art. The water is free. So drink.
Drink and be filled up.</li>
