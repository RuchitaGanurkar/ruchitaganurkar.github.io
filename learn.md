### What Am I Learning [ 2024 ]
> I started my career by carrying knowledge of different technologies.
> When someone asks me what would you prefer, keeping width or keeping height in this field?
> I firmly say it totally depends when do you start?
> I have seen people excelling in this field just by staying focused on 
> one particular thing. Along side, there are many examples who try out 
> all those possible combinations which brings challenges to them.
> I personally feel to keep your width of knowledge helps to servive in better ways.

HASKELL & RUST

> Haskell for obvious reason, I develop softwares in this language and yes it's self explored path.
> Rust, ah I don't have solid reason but seeing industry demand I felt to start with this.
> Let's put some hands on examples here next time!
